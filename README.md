### About
After running the <a class="button" href="//github.com/akrvch/yalantis-test-task/blob/master/SETUP.md">Installation</a> and running the server on localhost 
you will be taken to the home page.

There will be a menu with all API addresses.

All endpoints addresses are the same as specified in assigment.

`db.sqlite3` is included.

If you want to populate `Vehicle` and `Driver` tables you can also use the django admin panel.
Create a `superuser` to be able to access it:

```bash
$ python manage.py createsuperuser
```
